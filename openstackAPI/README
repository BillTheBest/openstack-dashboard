OpenStack django_open
---------------------

The Django-Nova project is a Django module that is used to provide web based
interactions with the OpenStack Nova cloud controller. The django_open module 
aims to provide equivalent functionality using the openstack API.

There is a reference implementation that uses this module located at:

    http://launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

    It is highly recommended that you make use of this reference implementation
    so that changes you make can be visualized effectively and are consistent.
    Using this reference implementation as a development environment will greatly
    simplify development of the django-nova module.
