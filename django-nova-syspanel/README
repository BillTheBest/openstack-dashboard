OpenStack Django-Nova-Syspanel
------------------------------

The Django-Nova-Syspanel package provides a django app that interacts
with the OpenStack Nova cloud controller to view the health of a
running OpenStack installation.

This is packaged, and intended to be used inside of, OpenStack
Dashboard, which is located at

    http://launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

Development against this application is best done inside this reference
implementation, though in practice any django app can install this
application.


Getting Started
---------------

Django-Nova-Syspanel uses Buildout (http://www.buildout.org/) to
manage local development.  To configure your local Buildout
environment:

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout

This will install all the dependencies of django-nova-syspanel and
provide some useful scripts in the bin/ directory:

  bin/python provides a python shell for the current buildout.
  bin/django provides django functions for the current buildout.


You should now be able to run unit tests as follows:

  $ bin/django test
